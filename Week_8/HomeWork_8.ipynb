    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we'll build a model for predicting if we have an image of a dino or a dragon. For this, we will use the \"Dino or Dragon?\" dataset that can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agrigorev/dino-or-dragon).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lectures we saw how to use a pre-trained neural network. In the homework, we'll train a much smaller model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You don't need a computer with a GPU for this homework. A laptop or any personal computer should be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains around 1900 images of dinos and around 1900 images of dragons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains separate folders for training and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework we will use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Like in the lectures, we'll use Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to develop the model with following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The shape for input should be (150, 150, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, create a convolutional layer ([Conv2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/)):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use 32 filters\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Kernel size should be (3, 3) (that's the size of the filter)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use 'relu' as activation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce the size of the feature map with max pooling ([MaxPooling2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/pooling_layers/max_pooling2d/))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Set the pooling size to (2, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Turn the multi-dimensional result into vectors using a [Flatten](https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/flatten/) layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, add a Dense layer with 64 neurons and 'relu' activation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, create the Dense layer with 1 neuron - this will be the output\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The output layer should have an activation - use the appropriate activation for the binary classification case\n",
    "\n",
    "- As optimizer use [SGD](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/sgd/) with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - SGD(lr=0.002, momentum=0.8)\n",
    "    \n",
    "For clarification about kernel size and max pooling, check [Office Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WRgdBTUaAc)."
